This 'test' directory is intended to serve for regression testing.

Inputs for tests are supposed to be created under inp/ (e.g. inp/xyztest.inp) 
Corresponding folders containing expected output should be under 
cmp/ (e.g. cmp/xyztest.cmp). The actual test runs should be executed in
run/ (e.g. run/xyztest.run). The run folder is ignored by git.

Builds for testing should be compiled via default pilot script compilation
and gfortran compiler.

Currently only one test ('templatest') is implemented. It tests a slightly
modified (less time consuming) version of the input from input_templates. 
It can be easily run by executing './templatest.sh $EXEC_PATH', where 
$EXEC_PATH should be the path of the HswfQMC executable you want to test. 
If it is the default 'HswfQMC_exe' in HswfQMC's main directory, you can 
simply run 'templatest.sh'. If the test output differs from the expected 
output, you can find the diff in 'run/templatest.diff'.
