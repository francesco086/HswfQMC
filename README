IMPORTANT:

1) You can set your PATH variable so that it will find the HswfQMC executable and pilot-HswfQMC.sh script by typing (in the current folder) "sh pilot-HswfQMC.sh setpath".
Don't use this command more times or you will keep append this path to the variable PATH.
After running this command, from now on you can use the script pilot-HswfQMC.sh from anywhere, just by typing "pilot-HswfQMC.sh <command>".
If you do not follow this instruction (setpath) the usage of the pilot script might crash/not work.
Type "pilot-HswfQMC.sh help" to see which are the implemented commands.

2) Please make sure to have a clean folder before committing/pushing.
So, please run "pilot-HswfQMC.sh precommit" before committing/pushing.
